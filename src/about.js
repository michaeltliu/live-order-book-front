            <h1>About LiveOrderBook.xyz</h1>
            <p>
                LiveOrderBook is built as a platform for betting on real-world events against friends. 
                Every room features its own simulated order book and exchange, allowing you to trade contracts
                in real-time. Whether you're betting on an NFL game or on random everyday prop bets, LiveOrderBook 
                offers a unique alternative to traditional casinos
                and sportsbooks. With no preset limitations or restrictions, every order book is a blank slate,
                giving you full control over the contracts you create and trade. To get started, create a room 
                and invite your friends. Submit orders, track market activity, and view price history all from the app. 
                Perfect for those who enjoy forecasting in a dynamic, fair marketplace!
